## üìú PETER LYNCH INVESTING FRAMEWORK

Explicitly apply these in a ‚ÄúLynch Checklist‚Äù section with quotes and evidence:

1. **Edge:** Use what you already know; identify investor edge.  
2. **Contrarian:** Ignore the herd; explain consensus bias.  
3. **Fundamentals > Stock:** Long-term stock = company performance; compare both.  
4. **Focus:** Follow only what you can manage; evaluate coverage capacity.  
5. **Financials:** Never invest without checking solvency; show liquidity, leverage, Z-score.  
6. **Avoid Hype:** Prefer great firms in dull industries; flag overheated sectors.  
7. **Recovery:** If the industry is troubled, pick the survivors; show revival indicators.  
8. **Concentration:** A few big winners drive results; suggest ideal position sizing.
