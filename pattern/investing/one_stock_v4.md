## üìú GUIDING PRINCIPLES ‚Äî PETER LYNCH RULES (TO BE EXPLICITLY APPLIED)

1. **Rule 1:** Your edge is what you already know ‚Äî highlight the investor‚Äôs informational edge based on industry familiarity.  
2. **Rule 2:** Ignore the herd ‚Äî assess consensus sentiment and identify independent reasoning.  
3. **Rule 3:** In the long term, stock performance tracks company performance ‚Äî evaluate the business fundamentals vs. stock price history.  
4. **Rule 4:** Own only what you can follow ‚Äî limit focus to a manageable coverage universe; recommend realistic monitoring depth.  
5. **Rule 5:** Understand finances ‚Äî inspect solvency, liquidity, leverage, and accounting quality (flag red zones).  
6. **Rule 6:** Avoid hot stocks in hot industries ‚Äî prefer solid companies in ignored or steady sectors.  
7. **Rule 7:** In troubled industries, buy survivors ‚Äî verify evidence of recovery before any ‚Äúturnaround‚Äù thesis.  
8. **Rule 8:** Concentrate intelligently ‚Äî show how 5 big winners can compound massive returns; provide allocation guidance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ANALYSIS TASKS

### 1. üßÆ Historical Performance & Statistical Tests
- Compute total return CAGR vs. benchmark (1/3/5/10/15y & since-IPO)
- Rolling 12m and 36m active returns distribution
- CAPM regression (alpha, beta, t-stats)
- Sharpe, Sortino, Information Ratio, Max Drawdown
- Bootstrap p-value for alpha significance
- Hit-rate: % of rolling 3y windows beating benchmark by >2% annualized

### 2. üíé Quality & Consistency Scoring (0‚Äì100)
Weighted components:
| Metric | Weight | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ROIC stability | 8% | Std. deviation of ROIC over 10y |
| FCF conversion | 7% | FCF/Net Income |
| Margin stability | 5% | Rolling 5y volatility |
| Piotroski F-Score | 5% | Accounting quality |
| Balance sheet strength | 5% | Leverage & liquidity metrics |
| Management capital allocation | 5% | Reinvestment vs. buyback logic |

### 3. üí∞ Valuation Analysis
**Models Required:**
- DCF (10-year explicit + terminal via both Gordon & exit multiple)
- Peer-relative multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E, P/FCF, PEG)
- Scenario valuation (Bear/Base/Bull with probabilities)

Include:
- Full DCF table (year-by-year FCFF, WACC inputs, terminal assumptions)
- Sensitivity grid: WACC ¬±1%, terminal growth ‚àí1% to +3%

### 4. üß± Moat & Durability
Rate and justify across five vectors:
1. Network Effects  
2. Switching Costs  
3. Scale Economies  
4. Brand/IP/Regulatory  
5. Cost Leadership  

‚Üí Output: **Moat Rating = None / Weak / Moderate / Strong / Enduring**

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Analysis
List **top 10 risks** with:
- Probability (%)
- NAV Impact (%)
- Mitigation / Monitoring metric
Use a concise table format.

### 6. üöÄ Catalysts
Time-staged list:
- Short-term (0‚Äì12m)
- Mid-term (1‚Äì3y)
- Long-term (3y+)
Include trigger events, expected impact, and confidence level.

### 7. üìä Position Sizing
Recommend allocations for:
- Concentrated 5-stock portfolio (% allocation)
- Diversified 20-stock portfolio (% allocation)
- Institutional block trade sizing (AUM $100M case, expected market impact)

### 8. üßæ Governance & ESG
Rate 1‚Äì5:
- Board independence
- CEO tenure & comp alignment
- Accounting transparency
- ESG red flags (if any)

## üìà SCORING SYSTEM (0‚Äì100)

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|---------|
| Historical Outperformance | 30% |
| Quality & Consistency | 25% |
| Valuation Attractiveness | 20% |
| Moat & Durability | 15% |
| Governance & Liquidity | 10% |

Compute **Composite Score = Œ£(weight √ó normalized_subscore)**.  
Also compute a **Consistency Index = % of 3y windows beating benchmark by >2%/yr**.
