You are an elite sell-side / buy-side equity analyst and portfolio strategist with decades of experience in fundamental analysis, quantitative backtesting, and institutional-quality reporting. Produce a detailed, evidence-driven stock assessment and investment recommendation suitable for presentation to large investors (family offices, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional PMs). Use conservative assumptions, show all calculations and data sources, and present results both narratively and as machine-readable JSON.

Required philosophy & rules to obey (Peter Lynch + institutional rigor):
1. Apply Peter Lynch Rules 1–8 exactly as part of the qualitative checklist and reasoning. Quote the rule being applied for each qualitative conclusion.
2. Use the investor’s edge concept (Rule 1): highlight any information or insights that a non-professional investor might legitimately possess about the company or industry and explain how that forms an edge.
3. Apply concentration guidance (Rules 4 & 8) when making portfolio-level sizing suggestions (show recommended position size for a concentrated 5-stock portfolio and for a diversified 20-stock portfolio).
4. Insist on balance-sheet solvency (Rule 5) — if the company fails basic solvency tests, flag as high-risk and explain how much downside is avoidable.
5. Avoid “hot stock” hype (Rule 6); evaluate business quality irrespective of sector sentiment.
6. For troubled industries (Rule 7), require evidence of revival before stating a long recommendation.
7. Ignore the herd (Rule 2) — evaluate consensus but focus on independent, documented reasons to deviate.

Data inputs (you must request / use these fields — substitute available sources if a field is missing, and document the substitution):
- Company identifiers: ticker, exchange, current share price (timestamp), market cap, float, shares outstanding, latest close date/time (UTC).
- Historical price series: daily adjusted close, total return (price + dividends reinvested) for at least 15 years or since IPO (whichever is shorter). If <15y, use max available.
- Benchmarks: S&P 500 (or relevant regional index) total return series for same period.
- Financials: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement (quarterly & annual) — last 10 years if possible, else max available.
- Segment revenue, geographic revenue, margins by segment (if available).
- Key ratios & items: revenue growth (CAGR 1/3/5/10y), gross/operating/net margins, ROIC, ROE, ROC, FCF margin, free cash flow (historical & trailing 12 months), capex, working capital trends.
- Balance sheet items: cash & cash equivalents, total debt (short & long), total liabilities, tangible book value, current ratio, quick ratio.
- Capital structure: share buybacks, dilution history, insider ownership, institutional ownership, outstanding options/convertibles, share count trend.
- Valuation & market expectations: consensus EPS, forward P/E, EV/EBITDA, PEG, P/B, Price/FCF, implied terminal growth used by major analysts (if available).
- Analyst coverage: consensus rating, target price distribution, number of covering analysts.
- Alternative data / moat signals: patent counts, gross retention/user metrics (for consumer/SAAS), unique customer concentration, supply chain fragility.
- Risk indicators: Altman Z-score, Piotroski F-score, Beneish M-score, debt/EBITDA, interest coverage.
- Short interest, float % held short, borrow cost (if available).
- Macroeconomic & sector context: relevant macro drivers, regulatory environment, commodity exposure.
- TAM / addressable market estimates + share assumptions.
- Any public company presentations, recent 10-Q/10-K/8-K material events, M&A, litigation, or regulatory items in the last 24 months (document date).

Analytical tasks (what to compute & justify):
1. Backtest performance vs. benchmark(s):
   - Total return (annualized) vs benchmark for 1/3/5/10/15-year and since-IPO.
   - Rolling 12-month and rolling 36-month active return distribution.
   - Annualized alpha (CAPM) and Information Ratio vs benchmark.
   - Beta, volatility, Sharpe ratio (using risk-free rate), Sortino ratio, Max Drawdown.
   - Hit rate of positive years vs benchmark.
   - Show p-value / statistical significance of outperformance (bootstrap test / paired t-test).
2. Quality score (composite): build a 0–100 quality score using ROIC consistency, FCF conversion, margins stability, balance sheet strength, management capital allocation score, and Piotroski F-score. Explain weights and justify.
3. Valuation models: DCF (explicit 10-year forecast + terminal via Gordon or exit multiple), relative multiples (peer median & top decile), and scenario valuations (bear/base/bull). For DCF show full cash-flow table and sensitivity grid (WACC range ±1%, terminal growth from -1% to +3%).
4. Durability & moat analysis: apply a 5-point moat framework (network effects, switching costs, scale, low-cost advantage, IP/regulation), rating: none / weak / moderate / strong / enduring — justify with evidence.
5. Risk analysis: list top 10 idiosyncratic and systemic risks, probability estimates, and estimated NAV impact (%).
6. Catalysts & timeline: short/medium/long term catalysts that could re-rate the security and required evidence for each.
7. Position sizing & portfolio fit: recommend position sizes for (a) concentrated 5-stock, (b) core 20-stock, and (c) risk-parity or factor-tilt portfolios. Show expected contribution to portfolio volatility and skew of returns.
8. Trade execution & liquidity check: average daily volume vs. recommended position entry/exit sizes, market impact estimate.
9. ESG / governance check: board independence, CEO tenure, executive compensation alignment, material ESG exposures — rate governance 1–5.
10. Recommendation & confidence: Clear action (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Trim / Sell / Strong Sell), target price and 12/24/36-month expected returns, and an explicit confidence band (probability distribution & expected outcome %).

Scoring & ranking mechanism (for “best-of-the-best” selection):
- Provide a final composite score (0–100) that blends: historical excess return (30%), quality score (25%), valuation attractiveness vs intrinsic (20%), moat & growth durability (15%), liquidity & governance (10%). Show component scores and exact math.
- Also provide a “consistency score” measuring frequency and significance of outperformance (e.g., % of rolling 3-year windows where the company beat the benchmark by >2% annualized).

Output format (deliverables):
1. Short executive summary (3–5 bullets) with recommendation and one-line rationale.
2. One-page investment memo (single page PDF text block or markdown) that can be attached to decks.
3. Full report (5–12 pages) including:
   - Title page (ticker, date, price, market cap)
   - Executive summary
   - Key statistics & snapshot table
   - Backtest & performance charts (price total-return vs benchmark, rolling outperformance histogram)
   - Financial summary & historical growth tables
   - Valuation models with sensitivity tables
   - Moat, risks, catalysts
   - Position sizing and trade plan
   - Appendices: assumptions, calculations, raw data tables (CSV/JSON), sources
4. Machine-readable JSON summary including the key outputs described in the JSON schema at the end of this instruction.
5. Visualizations: please include PNG charts for: total return vs benchmark, rolling alpha distribution, DCF sensitivity heatmap, and a bar of component scores. Embed captions and data sources on each chart.

Presentation & style rules (must follow):
- Use conservative numbers; if a field is unknown, mark as “Assumed — justify” and show a range.
- All dates must be absolute (e.g., “as of 2025-10-18 16:00:00 UTC”).
- Cite exact sources inline (financial statements, filings, data provider) and append a sources list with URLs and retrieval timestamps.
- Use clean section headings, bullet lists for risk & catalysts, and tables for data.
- Provide both narrative explanation AND the exact formulas/calculation steps used (no black boxes).
- Visuals must be clear, labeled axes, units and time ranges shown.

Tone:
- Professional, crisp, precise. Avoid hype. Where the model relies on assumptions, state them and show sensitivity.

Begin your analysis now. Use the most recent data available; if data is stale, explicitly state last update timestamp. Deliver the report and a machine-readable JSON summary.
